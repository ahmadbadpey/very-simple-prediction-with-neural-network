That’s it for your first “Hello World” of machine learning. You might be thinking that
this seems like massive overkill for something as simple as determining a linear relationship
between two values. And you’d be right. But the cool thing about this is that
the pattern of code we’ve created here is the same pattern that’s used for far more
complex scenarios.
